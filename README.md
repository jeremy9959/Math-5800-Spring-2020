**Description:**  This is a project-based course in which students will explore both practical and mathematical problems arising in machine learning and data science.  Possible topics include random walks for graph embeddings, optimization techniques, Monte Carlo methods, autoencoders, and linear and non-linear dimension reduction.

### "Syllabus"

Notes from the first two weeks:

- [Week 1](Week1.md)
- [Week 2](Week2.md)

For the remainder of the course we will follow this outline:

- Mondays: I will meet with each group for about 15 minutes during class just to make sure everyone is making progress.
- Wednesdays: Each group will present where they are to the class.  The rules are that everyone in the group must speak.
- Fridays: I will usually give a brief presentation on a topic in machine learning.  So far I've discussed:

	- [Bias and Variance](notebooks/BiasVariance.html)
	- [Polynomial Regression](notebooks/PolynomialRegression.html)  
	- [Curse of Dimensionality](notebooks/CurseOfDimensionality.html)
	- [Precision and Recall](notebooks/PrecisionRecall.html)
