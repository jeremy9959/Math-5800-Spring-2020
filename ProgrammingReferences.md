# Learning Python for ML


This page is intended to collect tutorial resources that people can use
to learn or improve their knowledge of Python.

*The best way to learn any programming language is to try to use it.*  You'll never be able to read a book
and remember the syntax, but if you try to do a small project it will drive the ideas home.

## OReilly library

We are fortunate at UConn to have access to the entire [O'Reilly Library](http://www.oreilly.com).
From that home page:

- click the "SIGN IN" button on the top right.
- click "SIGN IN HERE" on the next page and say you want to use SSO login
- login with your UConn userid and password.

From here you can get online access to every book in the massive O'Reilly library.  Some
useful specifics:

1. [Introducing Python, 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/). This is
an elementary introduction to the language from the beginning.   Good for programming novices, for whom Python is the first
real computer language.

2. [Python for Programmers, 1st Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/). I don't
know this book, but it looks interesting: it's intended for experienced programmers learning Python and claims to have
examples from Machine Learning to illustrate its points.

3. [Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/). Much of this 
book is devoted to the pandas library, which is the python library for manipulating data.  Proficiency with pandas makes
it possible to do a lot of data manipulation quickly and efficiently.

There are other, more advanced books, including introductions to TensorFlow, all available free on this site.

## MOOCS

There are a lot of online courses on the web that teach python.  They are of varying quality and some are quite expensive.
One option that is affordable and pretty comprehensive is this [Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/).
It covers an enormous amount of stuff, with lots of examples, and you would probably only need the first 5 or 6 sections
to really get going.  If you use your uconn email, this should only cost you $9.99. **DO NOT PAY MORE!**  If you get a higher
price quoted, let me know.
