    "### Preliminaries: Samples and Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in machine learning problems is to extract meaningful information from a collection of data.  In many cases the data is naturally organized into a large number of samples, and, for each sample, a large collection of measurements or *features*.   Depending on whether we are doing classification or regression, we are trying to extract the label or the output value as a function of the features of a sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In the MNIST data set, each image is a sample and the features are the 784 pixel values for each image. \n",
    "- In the Zillow home price algorithm, the samples are houses, the features are the characteristics of the house, and the target to be predicted is the selling price.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases the features are a mix of types -- some are numerical, some quantitative.  For example,\n",
    "in the Zillow data, some relevant features might be past selling price and taxes, and others might be whether or not the house has Air Conditioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good practice to organize your data so that the ROWS are samples (or observations) and the COLUMNS are features (or variables).   This is consistent with what's called [tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf).  A great deal of software expects your data to be organized in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you have to make choices about what are your samples and what are your features.  For example,\n",
    "in the movie recommendation problem you have a collection of data of the form (person, movie, rating).\n",
    "To use this data you need to \"unbundle\" it.  You can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create a matrix whose rows correspond to people and whose columns correspond to movies.  From this point of view, an \"observation\" consists of finding a person and asking them their opinion about a bunch of movies.\n",
    "- create a matrix whose rows are movies and whose columns are people.  From this point of view, an \"observation\" consists of collecting individual opinions from many people about that particular movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which approach is correct depends on your goal. For us, if you want to recommend movies to people based on the opinions of other people with similar tastes, then your observations are people and your features are the movies that they like.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems to me that in the reinforcement learning problem, the features are the many states of the game, plus whose turn it is to move.  The samples are the games themselves. \n",
