We construct a Markov Chain $x0,x1,\\ldots$ in such a way that the stationary distribution of the Markov Chain is $P$.  Then we run the Markov Chain for a long time until we think the dynamics are close to the stationary distribution, and we consider the steps of the chain to be samples from the distribution.  Note that these are NOT really independent samples, but they are (hopefully) good enough.\n",
