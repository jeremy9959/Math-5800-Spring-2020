## Skills and Interests.md

Our class is made up of people with diverse backgrounds and interests.  As a first activity,
we need to get to know each other so that we can form groups with complementary skills and
overlapping interests.

To do this assessment, we will divide up the whiteboards in Bousefield A105 by skills
and interests and people will write their names in places that match their profile.

Two comments:

**I know a few of the things on the list, but there are lots of things here  I don't know,
though I wish I did, so don't be intimidated!**

**The very "know" in this context means -- I have done this, I'm familiar with it. It does  not
mean "I am prepared
to take an exam on the topic right now!"**
